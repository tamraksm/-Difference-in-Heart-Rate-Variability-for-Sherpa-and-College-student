Helaine Alessio, Department Chair, and Alex Claiborne, second year graduate student, from
Miami Universityâ€™s Department of Kinesiology & Health, want to examine the association between heart
rate variability and several predictors. Proposed as a sign of increased health, more heart rate variability
is found in younger and more active individuals. Through a recent academic trip to Nepal, data were
collected on both students and Sherpa (local mountaineers). This data is to be used to compare the two
groups.
